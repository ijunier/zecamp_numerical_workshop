## Objectives

To familiarize oneself with a single computational framework that will, in parallel, allow us to:

- ensure reproducible access to data and to the associated analysis and modeling tools
- maintain a well-documented record of our progress using [GitHub](https://github.com)
- demonstrate how to easily:
    - write a numerical Markdown notebook (this file) that supports visualizations and quick note-taking
    - run a cell-by-cell Jupyter notebook to analyze data and model genome sequences from *E. coli* strains available in the [data folder](data/), starting with [the simplest code one can think of](jupyter_notebooks/hello_data.ipynb)
    - draft notes (like this one) including LaTeX $\rightarrow$ this might later serve as the basis for an article; note, however, that not all symbols are available
- use a GitHub repository to:
    - start collaborating
    - keep a historical backup of our work

To that end, we will proceed step by step, sometimes in an apparently random order relative to the outline above.
